### Hi there 👋
🚀 I am Jared,A computing science graduate and a chronic developer. My journey into the world of technology has been anything but ordinary. Growing up in the heart of Africa, I had my first encounter with an actual computer at the age of 16. It was a moment that forever changed my life. The sheer power and endless possibilities that technology held fascinated me beyond words.

🎯 My mission is clear: to empower progress through innovative computing solutions. I am dedicated to leveraging cutting-edge technologies to drive positive change and advancements. Whether it's architecting, developing, or optimizing software systems, I aim not only to meet the highest standards of performance and efficiency but also to enrich lives, streamline processes, and inspire innovation. I believe in the power of technology to tranform businesses and positively impact the world.
